            <h3>Trying to Learn Web Development</h3>
            <p>
                I am NILADRY SHEKHAR RAT. I am from Khulna Bangladesh. I have been planning to learn Web Development for
                a long time. But could not start it. Last year I have come to know about programming hero. I watched
                some videos of Jhangkar Mahbub. That grew interest in me to learn web development from Programming Hero.
                And that is why I enrolled for their course. I have started learning with Jhangkar vai from 30 of Jun
                2022. Lets see what happens! I am hopeful!!!

                I already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma
                how
                to make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics.
